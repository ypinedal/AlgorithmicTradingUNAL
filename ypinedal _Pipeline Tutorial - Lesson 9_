Datasets and BoundColumns
DataSets are simply collections of objects that tell the Pipeline API where and how to find the inputs to computations. An example of a DataSet that we have already seen is USEquityPricing.
A BoundColumn is a column of data that is concretely bound to a DataSet. Instances of BoundColumns are dynamically created upon access to attributes of DataSets. Inputs to pipeline computations must be of type BoundColumn. An example of a BoundColumn that we have already seen is USEquityPricing.close.
It is important to understand that DataSets and BoundColumns do not hold actual data. Remember that when computations are created and added to a pipeline, they don't actually perform the computation until the pipeline is run. DataSet and BoundColumns can be thought of in a similar way; they are simply used to identify the inputs of a computation. The data is populated later when the pipeline is run.
dtypes
When defining pipeline computations, we need to know the types of our inputs in order to know which operations and functions we can use. The dtype of a BoundColumn tells a computation what the type of the data will be when the pipeline is run. For example, USEquityPricing has a float dtype so a factor may perform arithmetic operations on USEquityPricing.close (e.g. compute the 5-day mean). The importance of this will become more clear in the next lesson.
The dtype of a BoundColumn can also determine the type of a computation. In the case of the latest computation, the dtype determines whether the computation is a factor (float), a filter (bool), or a classifier (string, int).
Pricing Data
US equity pricing data is stored in the USEquityPricing dataset. USEquityPricing provides five columns:
 USEquityPricing.open
 USEquityPricing.high
 USEquityPricing.low
 USEquityPricing.close
 USEquityPricing.volume
Each of these columns has a float dtype.
Fundamental Data
Quantopian provides a number of fundamental data fields sourced from Morningstar. Each field exists as a BoundColumn under the Fundamentals dataset, and there are over 900 columns available. See the Quantopian Fundamentals Reference for a full description of each of these columns.
The dtypes of the columns vary. For example, Fundamentals.market_cap is a column representing the most recently reported market cap for each asset on each date, and has a float dtype.
Partner Data
Many datasets besides USEquityPricing and Morningstar fundamentals are available on Quantopian. These include consensus estimates data, news sentiment, and more. Most datasets are namespaced by provider under quantopian.pipeline.data.
 quantopian.pipeline.data.psychsignal (PsychSignal)
 quantopian.pipeline.data.sentdex (Sentdex)
Similar to USEquityPricing, the two datasets listed above have columns (BoundColumns) that can be used in pipeline computations. The columns, along with example algorithms and notebooks can be found on the Data Reference. The dtypes of the columns vary.
BoundColumns are most commonly used in CustomFactors which we will explore in the next lesson.
